## Introduction
Our project aims to explore and decipher the rich dataset obtained from an extensive six-year industry survey focusing on data science and machine learning. This annual survey, conducted between 2017 and 2022, amassed a wealth of diverse responses, offering a global panorama of these rapidly evolving fields. Our objective is to delve deeper into this trove of information, uncovering captivating narratives and insightful trends within specific subsets of the data science community. Through a blend of narrative text and data exploration, our endeavor is to present compelling stories that reflect the experiences, preferences, and changes within various niches of the data science realm.

## Problem Statement
The project’s primary focus revolves around understanding the evolving preferences and tool usage among diverse subsets of data science practitioners over the surveyed years. Specifically, we aim to investigate and track the changing landscape of tool adoption and preferences across different continents or regions. This exploration intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the utilization of tools in data science has evolved geographically, shedding light on trends and patterns unique to specific regions or communities.
